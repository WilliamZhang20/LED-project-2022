# LED-project-2022

In this project, I programmed a set of six LED lights using a Raspberry Pi to randomly light up individual LEDs. When the user runs the code, the program will randomly select one of the six LEDs and turn it on for 0.7 seconds. The process is then repeated 50 times, and each time, the program will select a different random light.
