# Raspberry-Pi-Projects

A collection of all the projects that I do using a Raspberry Pi

## LED Project (July 2022)
In this project, I programmed a set of six LED lights using a Raspberry Pi to randomly light up individual LEDs. When the user runs the code, the program will randomly select one of the six LEDs and turn it on for 0.7 seconds. This is done 50 times, and each time, the program will select a different random light. 

## Camera Project (July 2022)
In this project, I controlled the Raspberry Pi Camera Module to take photos periodically every 10 seconds. Each time, the program will send the photo to my email as an attachment.
