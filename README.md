# Raspberry-Pi-Projects

A collection of all the projects that I do using a Raspberry Pi

# LED Project (July 2022)
In this project, I programmed a set of six LED lights using a Raspberry Pi to randomly light up individual LEDs. When the user runs the code, the program will randomly select one of the six LEDs and turn it on for 0.7 seconds. The process is then repeated 50 times, and each time, the program will select a different random light. 

# Camera Project (July 2022)
In this project, I used the Raspberry Pi Camera Module to take a photo every 10 seconds for five times. Each time, it will send the photo to my email, one by one. Code will be uploaded soon.
